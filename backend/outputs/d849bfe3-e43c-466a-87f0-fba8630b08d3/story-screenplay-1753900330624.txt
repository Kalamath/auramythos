INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Alice walks through the aisles of the grocery store, heading towards the dairy section. She grabs a carton of milk and heads to the checkout.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

As Alice exits the grocery store, she sees a RACCOON rummaging through a trash can. The raccoon looks up and stares at her.

ALICE
(startled)
Oh, hello there little guy. What are you doing here?

The raccoon scurries away, disappearing into a nearby bush. Alice chuckles to herself and continues on her way.
